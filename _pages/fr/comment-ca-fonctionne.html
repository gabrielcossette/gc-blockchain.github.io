  <h2>How it works</h2>

  <h3>Key Dates</h3>
  <p>The kick-off is Tuesday, April 17th, 2018 as part of the quarterly Government of Canada Blockchain Working Group meeting.  All registrants will be forwarded an email invitation to attend the kick-off as a virtual participant using a teleconference and WebEx.</p>
  <p>The deadline for solution submissions is Monday, April 23rd at 9:00am EST</p>
  
  <h3>Team Formation</h3>
  <p>The GC Blockchain Codefest is open to everyone, including the federal, provincial/territorial public service as well as students and teachers from universities and colleges in Canada.  Individuals that do not have a team are encouraged to register as a participant for the location of their choice and their registration details will be forwarded to the event organizer for follow-up.</p>
  <p>The GC Blockchain Codefest is not just for people who code; a diversity of skills, experience and ideas, contributing to a unified cause, will results in richer and more diverse outcomes.</p>

  <h3>Themes</h3>
  <p>Teams will select one theme from a provided list of public sector use cases.</p>
  <p>A team may contact TBS and propose an alternative public sector use case.</p>

  <h3>Submissions</h3>
  <p>Submissions that fail to address a public sector need or opportunity will be rejected.</p>
  <p>The GC Blockchain Day event on April 23rd will be a showcase of all of the approved submissions</p>

  <h3>Locations</h3>
  <p>The primary codefest will occur in Ottawa for GC employees during the week of April 16th and confirmed satellite codefest locations will occur in Calgary, Montreal, Toronto, St. Johnâ€™s, Seattle, Johannesburg, and Ghana.</p>
  <p>Each location will have a separate EventBrite ticket to help the local organizers manage their attendees.</p>
  <p>Each satellite location will adhere to the provided guidelines from TBS and they will independently operate their own codefest based upon the availability of a location and participants.</p>

  <h3>Collaboration tools</h3>
  <p>Slack, Twitter, GitHub, YouTube and WebEx will be used to manage the communication from the 17th - 23rd.</p>
  <p>1-2 follow-up meetings will be setup with all of the satellite location participants via WebEx.</p>

  <h3>Register</h3>
